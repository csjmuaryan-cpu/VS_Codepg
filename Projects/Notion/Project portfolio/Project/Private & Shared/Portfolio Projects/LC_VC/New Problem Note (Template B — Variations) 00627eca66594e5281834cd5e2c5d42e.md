### Variations Map

| Variant | Change vs base | Key Trick | Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Variant 1 | ... | ... | O(...)/O(...) |
| Variant 2 | ... | ... | O(...)/O(...) |

### Pitfalls Checklist

- [ ]  Off-by-one indices
- [ ]  Overflow or modulo errors
- [ ]  Wrong data structure complexity
- [ ]  Missed edge constraints
- [ ]  Early return conditions

### Pattern Recipe

1. Identify inputs and constraints quickly
2. Detect candidate patterns from tags or constraints
3. Write minimal counterexamples to test assumptions
4. Lock complexity target, then choose DS accordingly
5. Prove correctness with invariants or induction
