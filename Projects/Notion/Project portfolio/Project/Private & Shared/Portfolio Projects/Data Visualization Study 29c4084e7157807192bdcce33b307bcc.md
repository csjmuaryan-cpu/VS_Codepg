# Overview

This research project explores effective visualization methods for complex healthcare datasets, with a specific focus on pediatric data visualization techniques.

## Research Objectives

- Identify best practices for visualizing complex healthcare datasets
- Evaluate effectiveness of different visualization libraries and tools
- Ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements throughout the research
- Develop recommendations for pediatric data-specific visualizations

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Visualization Techniques

Exploring various approaches including:

- Interactive dashboards for real-time data monitoring
- Time-series visualizations for patient data trends
- Hierarchical visualizations for complex medical relationships
- Geographic mapping for epidemiological data

### 2. Healthcare Data Challenges

- Handling high-dimensional medical datasets
- Preserving patient privacy while maintaining data utility
- Dealing with missing or incomplete healthcare records
- Representing uncertainty in medical data

### 3. Tools & Technologies
