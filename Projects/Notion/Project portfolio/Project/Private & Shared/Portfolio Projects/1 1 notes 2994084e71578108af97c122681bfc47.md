## 🎯 Purpose

Create a unified, well-organized repository structure that makes technical notes:

- **Discoverable** - Easy to find specific topics
- **Maintainable** - Consistent format across all notes
- **Shareable** - Professional presentation for portfolio
- **Educational** - Clear learning path for each technology

## 📁 Repository Structure

The framework organizes notes into 8 major domains:

### 1. **AI Notes** 🤖

Machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and computer vision fundamentals

### 2. **DSA Notes** 🔢

Data structures, algorithms, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming

### 3. **C/C++ Notes** 💾

Language fundamentals, OOP, STL, and templates

### 4. **Python Programming** 🐍

From basics to advanced topics, including popular libraries

### 5. **SQL Notes** 🗃️

Database design, queries, joins, and optimization

### 6. **HTML/CSS Notes** 🎨

Web fundamentals, responsive design, and modern CSS techniques

### 7. **Web Development** 🌐

Frontend and backend technologies, full-stack projects

### 8. **Java Notes** ☕

Core Java, OOP, collections, and frameworks

## 📝 Note Template Structure

Each note follows a consistent format:

### Topic Structure

- **Topic Overview** - Brief introduction
- **Key Concepts** - Main ideas explained
- **Code Examples** - Practical demonstrations
- **Practice Problems** - Exercises with solutions
- **References** - Additional learning resources

### File Organization
